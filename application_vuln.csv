The SYSENTER instruction leaves various state sanitization activities to software. One of Xen's sanitization paths injects a #GP faultand incorrectly delivers it twice to the guest. This causes the guest kernel to observe a kernel-privilege #GP fault (typically fatal) rather than a user-privilege #GP fault (usually converted into SIGSEGV/etc.). Malicious or buggy userspace can crash the guest kernelresulting in a VM Denial of Service. All versions of Xen from 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM platforms are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that support the SYSENTER instruction in 64bit mode are vulnerable. This is believed to be IntelCentaurand Shanghai CPUs.

In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By defaultit is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increasedreceiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarioswhich would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By defaultauthenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the “CONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len” to change the safe defaultmaking the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit systemor as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newerACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versionsthe `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to usersrendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways."

When a Xenstore watch firesthe xenstore client that registered the watch will receive a Xenstore message containing the path of the modified Xenstore entry that triggered the watchand the tag that was specified when registering the watch. Any communication with xenstored is done via Xenstore messagesconsisting of a message header and the payload. The payload length is limited to 4096 bytes. Any request to xenstored resulting in a response with a payload longer than 4096 bytes will result in an error. When registering a watchthe payload length limit applies to the combined length of the watched path and the specified tag. Because watches for a specific path are also triggered for all nodes below that paththe payload of a watch event message can be longer than the payload needed to register the watch. A malicious guest that registers a watch using a very large tag (i.e.with a registration operation payload length close to the 4096 byte limit) can cause the generation of watch events with a payload length larger than 4096 bytesby writing to Xenstore entries below the watched path. This will result in an error condition in xenstored. This error can result in a NULL pointer dereferenceleading to a crash of xenstored. A malicious guest administrator can cause xenstored to crashleading to a denial of service. Following a xenstored crashdomains may continue to runbut management operations will be impossible.

"219","Dropbox Update Helper","1.3.459.1","CVE-2021-21283","DropboxInc.","Undetermined","Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The ""Flarum Sticky"" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributesenabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussionan attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussionor be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staffyou can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content historyyou cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled."

""Linear pagetables"" is a technique which involves either pointing a pagetable at itselfor to another pagetable of the same or higher level. Xen has limited support for linear pagetables: A page may either point to itselfor point to another pagetable of the same level (i.e.L2 to L2L3 to L3and so on). XSA-240 introduced an additional restriction that limited the ""depth"" of such chains by allowing pages to either *point to* other pages of the same levelor *be pointed to* by other pages of the same levelbut not both. To implement thiswe keep track of the number of outstanding times a page points to or is pointed to another page tableto prevent both from happening at the same time. Unfortunatelythe original commit introducing this reset this count when resuming validation of a partially-validated pagetableincorrectly dropping some ""linear_pt_entry"" counts. If an attacker could engineer such a situation to occurthey might be able to make loops or other arbitrary chains of linear pagetablesas described in XSA-240. A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause the hypervisor to crashresulting in Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded. All versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability. Only systems which have enabled linear pagetables are vulnerable. Systems which have disabled linear pagetableseither by selecting CONFIG_PV_LINEAR_PT=n when building the hypervisoror adding pv-linear-pt=false on the command-lineare not vulnerable."

In msgpack5 before versions 3.6.14.5.1and 5.2.1 there is a ""Prototype Poisoning"" vulnerability. When msgpack5 decodes a map containing a key ""__proto__""it assigns the decoded value to __proto__. Object.prototype.__proto__ is an accessor property for the receiver's prototype. If the value corresponding to the key __proto__ decodes to an object or nullmsgpack5 sets the decoded object's prototype to that value. An attacker who can submit crafted MessagePack data to a service can use this to produce values that appear to be of other types; may have unexpected prototype properties and methods (for example lengthnumeric propertiesand push et al if __proto__'s value decodes to an Array); and/or may throw unexpected exceptions when used (for example if the __proto__ value decodes to a Map or Date). Other unexpected behavior might be produced for other types. There is no effect on the global prototype. This ""prototype poisoning"" is sort of a very limited inversion of a prototype pollution attack. Only the decoded value's prototype is affectedand it can only be set to msgpack5 values (though if the victim makes use of custom codecsanything could be a msgpack5 value). We have not found a way to escalate this to true prototype pollution (absent other bugs in the consumer's code). This has been fixed in msgpack5 version 3.6.14.5.1and 5.2.1.

Firstthe code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79).

The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermorebecause the pointer advance is far wider than desiredthis quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned herebut more severe attacks can be mounted toogiven that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory.

We did not take that into account when creating the path resolve function. The issue is patched in version 4.4.0 (commit 457b859450a37cba10ff3c431eb4aa67771122e3)."

In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposedbut a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerableGSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Sambaas well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditionsthe ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacksdepending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platformsthis flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-readleading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platformsthis flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos librarieswhich support a broad range of operating systemsrendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Thereforeto reduce the attack surface for BIND userswe will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BINDbut since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementationwe have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security."

The ""Flarum Sticky"" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributesenabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussionan attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussionor be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staffyou can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content historyyou cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes.

Firstthe code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79).

The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermorebecause the pointer advance is far wider than desiredthis quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned herebut more severe attacks can be mounted toogiven that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory.

In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposedbut a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerableGSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Sambaas well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditionsthe ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacksdepending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platformsthis flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-readleading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platformsthis flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos librarieswhich support a broad range of operating systemsrendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Thereforeto reduce the attack surface for BIND userswe will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BINDbut since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementationwe have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security."
